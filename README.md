## Description:
Our project is essentially a news site, such as the New York Times, which displays data from a variety of topics including weather, current events, sports, and arts. Each of these pages contain information from reliable APIs, which can all be found in our API knowledge base. In the arts page specifically, we utilize SearchApi so that you can search up any artwork you find interesting and read a description on the web about it. SearchApi will also be used on the sports page to search for specific sports and game sessions for those sports. By logging in to the page, each user can ‘favorite’ their posts to view later, but this feature is not possible if you are not logged in.
